# Java-Server
This is a basic server. It serves the content of the folder given as an argument and only understands basic HTTP petitions (GET). It uses a cache and can be controled by a control client. This control client can flush the cache, change the delete policy, list the cache elements or delete one element of the cache. The cache and the control client use a specific protocol, not HTTP.
